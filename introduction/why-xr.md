# Why XR and not X?

ü§≠ Oh no, another debugger!

## Lightweight

XR is *very* lightweight, you don't need anything extra besides PHP and a web browser to use it. No need to install any distro-based package or even tweak your `php.ini`.

## Ephemeral

*And its gone!*

One-click command run in split seconds the XR server and dispose it when done, no need to copile/re-configure your PHP extensions. It doesn't require a database or any other persistence requirement.

## Web application

*Need to toy with dump messages?*

Easy interact with the debugger to to pause, resume, clear, copy and even export messages. XR has been built to enable users to handle dump messages with ease and to share these messages with other peers.

## Beautiful looking dumps‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

*You'll never see better looking dumps!*

We [built a new var dumper](https://github/chevere/var-dump) and it looks fantastic. Forget the ubiqutus `var-dumper` style without *style* , your sight will be pleased as you will enjoy a more colorful experience.

## Context

*Keep messages organized by topics and emotes.*

XR uses topics and emotes to provide extra context to your dump information. These can be used as filters in the debugger window, enabling you to filter among multiple messages.

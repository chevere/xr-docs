# Why XR Debug and not X?

## Lightweight

*Small package, low dependencies.*

XR Debug is very lightweight, doesn't need anything extra besides PHP and a web browser to use it. No distro-based package, no extra installs, compile extensions or even tweak your `php.ini`.

## Ephemeral

*And its gone!*

One-click command run XR Debug server and dispose it when done. It doesn't require a database or any other persistence requirement.

## Web application

*Want to toy with dump messages?*

Interact with the debugger to pause, resume, clear, copy and even export messages. XR Debug has been built to enable users to handle dump messages with ease and to share these messages with other peers.

## Beautiful looking dumps™️

*You'll never see better looking dumps!*

We [built a new var dumper](https://github.com/chevere/var-dump) and it looks fantastic. Forget the ubiquitous `var-dumper` style without *any style*, your sight will be pleased as you will enjoy a more colorful *chevere* experience.

## Context

*Organize dumps with topics and emotes.*

XR Debug uses topics and emotes to provide extra context to your dump information, enabling you to filter among multiple messages.

# Why XR and not X?

## Lightweight

*Small package, low dependencies.*

XR is very lightweight, doesn't need anything extra besides PHP and a web browser to use it. No distro-based package, compile extensions or even tweak your `php.ini`.

## Ephemeral

*And its gone!*

One-click command run XR server and dispose it when done, no need to copile/re-configure your PHP extensions. It doesn't require a database or any other persistence requirement.

## Web application

*Want to toy with dump messages?*

Interact with the debugger to pause, resume, clear, copy and even export messages. XR has been built to enable users to handle dump messages with ease and to share these messages with other peers.

## Beautiful looking dumps™️

*You'll never see better looking dumps!*

We [built a new var dumper](https://github.com/chevere/var-dump) and it looks fantastic. Forget the ubiquitous `var-dumper` style without *any style* , your sight will be pleased as you will enjoy a more colorful *chevere* experience.

## Context

*Keep messages organized by topics and emotes.*

XR uses topics and emotes to provide extra context to your dump information. These can be used as filters in the debugger window, enabling you to filter among multiple messages.

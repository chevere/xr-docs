# Get started

## What is xrDebug?

xrDebug is a dump debug utility providing an [application server](../running/README.md) where you can send debug payloads, and stream these messages to multiple peers in any web browser.

Here's, this is what you write in your code:

```php
xr('Hello, world!');

xr(theArray: ['a' => 0, 'b' => 1], t: 'my-topic', e: 'ðŸ“Œ');

xr(ðŸ¤­: 'wow', ðŸ‘½: 'many', ðŸ˜Ž: 'args');
```

Here's how it looks in xrDebug:

There are other [helper functions](../helpers/README.md) that allow you to show system information, pause your code, etc. You can easily build your own custom helpers to dump functions tailored for your specific application context.

## How it works?

* xrDebug listens to messages emitted from your code.
* Calls to xrDebug helpers in your code emit a message to server.

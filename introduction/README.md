# Introduction

XR is a dump debug server utility for PHP. No extras required, debug your PHP code anywhere.

Here's an example for any PHP code:

```php
xr('Hello, world!');

xr(theArray: ['a' => 0, 'b' => 1], t: 'my-topic', e: 'ðŸ“Œ');

xr(ðŸ¤­: 'wow', ðŸ‘½: 'many', ðŸ˜Ž: 'args');
```

Here's how it looks in XR debugger:

There are other helper functions that allow you to show system information, pause your code, etc. You can easily build your own dump functions tailored for your specific application context.

## How it works?

ðŸ’¡ Calls to `xr()` in your code emit a message to the XR server.

XR spawns an HTTP web application server (ReactPHP) with SSE to broadcast dump messages emited from your code.

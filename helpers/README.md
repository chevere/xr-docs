# Helpers

Helpers refer to functions available at user-land code that can be used to interact with xrDebug. A client library implementing [xrDebug API](../developer/api.md) should provide the following helpers to conveniently debug your code:

* xrDebug [xr](xr.md)
* xrDebug Raw [xrr](xrr.md)
* xrDebug Inspector [xri](xri.md)
